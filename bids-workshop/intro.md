# Welcome to my BIDS Workshop!

I am Steven Meisler, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Pennsylvania
working in [Ted Satterthwaite's lab](http://pennlinc.io/)

I am preparing this workshop as part of my [ReproNim/INCF Fellowship](https://www.repronim.org/fellowship.html),
but also because I really like helping people do neuroimaging better
(and do not like seeing research done "wrong" or irreproducibly).

This course is being taught in-person at the Ohio State University,
and thus some code will be specific to their cluster, but the
general process described here should work for practically any computing cluster!
